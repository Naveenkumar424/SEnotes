*Functional Requirements:
    Functional requirements define what the system should do.
They describe the specific behaviors, functions, and features that the software must perform to meet user needs.
Examples: User authentication, data validation, report generation, and search functionality.

*Non-Functional Requirements:
    Non-functional requirements define how the system should perform.
They focus on the quality attributes and operational aspects of the system, such as performance, security, and usability.
Examples: Performance (e.g., response times), security (e.g., data encryption), usability (e.g., intuitive interface), reliability (e.g., uptime), and scalability (e.g., handling increased users).

**Key Differences:
    >Nature: Functional requirements are task-specific, 
        while non-functional requirements focus on qualities and performance.
    >Measurability: Functional requirements are easier to measure due to their specificity,
        whereas non-functional requirements involve more subjective qualities.


*Software Requirements Specification Document:
    A Software Requirements Specification Document(SRSD) document outlines the functionalities and constraints
of a software system. It serves as a formal agreement between stakeholders, providing a comprehensive description of what the software will do and how it will perform.

    Entity-Relationship Diagrams: Diagrams showing data relationships.

6. Glossary
    List of terms and definitions used in the document.


*Requirement Engineering Process:
    The requirements engineering process involves a systematic approach to identifying, documenting,
and managing the requirements of a software system. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform. Here's an overview of the key steps in the requirements engineering process:

1. Requirements Elicitation
    Goal: Gather requirements from stakeholders, including customers, users, and other stakeholders.

    Techniques:

        Interviews: Conduct one-on-one or group interviews to understand stakeholder needs.

        Surveys and Questionnaires: Use structured forms to collect information from a large audience.

        Workshops: Facilitate collaborative sessions to gather and refine requirements.

        Observation: Observe users in their environment to understand their workflows and needs.

        Document Analysis: Review existing documentation to extract relevant information.

2. Requirements Analysis
    Goal: Analyze and refine the gathered requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, consistent, and feasible.

    Activities:

        Prioritization: Determine the importance of each requirement.

        Conflict Resolution: Address and resolve any conflicting requirements.

        Feasibility Analysis: Assess the feasibility of the requirements in terms of technical, economic, and legal constraints.

        Modeling: Create models (e.g., use case diagrams, data flow diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

3. Requirements Specification
    Goal: Document the requirements in a structured format that is clear and understandable to all stakeholders.

    Outputs:

        Software Requirements Specification (SRS): A comprehensive document detailing the functional and non-functional requirements.

        User Stories: Short descriptions of features from the perspective of end-users (commonly used in agile development).

        Use Cases: Detailed descriptions of user interactions with the system.

4. Requirements Validation
    Goal: Ensure that the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs and are complete, consistent, and feasible.

    Techniques:

        Reviews and Inspections: Conduct formal reviews and inspections of the requirements document.

        Prototyping: Develop prototypes to validate and refine requirements.

        Test Cases: Create test cases based on requirements to ensure they are testable.

        Stakeholder Feedback: Gather feedback from stakeholders to verify the requirements.

5. Requirements Management
    Goal: Manage changes to the requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

    Activities:

        Change Control: Implement a process for handling changes to requirements.

        Version Control: Maintain version control of requirements documents.

        Traceability: Establish traceability links between requirements and other project artifacts (e.g., design documents, test cases).

        Monitoring and Reporting: Track the status of requirements and report on their progress.

**Summary
The requirements engineering process is critical for the successful development of software systems. It ensures that the final product meets the needs and expectations of stakeholders, and it helps to minimize risks associated with incomplete or misunderstood requirements. By following these steps, you can effectively gather, analyze, document, validate, and manage requirements throughout the software development lifecycle.
